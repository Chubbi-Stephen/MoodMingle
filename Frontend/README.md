# MoodMingle 💬 👾

This is a chat UI built entirely with Javascript (React specifically) 😃

All you need to run the webstie is NPM installed on your computer!

To run the website, clone the director, `cd` into it with your terminal:

## 2. Run the code!

```
npm install # to install all packages
npm run dev # to start the website
```

Then, your webstie will be running at http://localhost:5173/

Done 🎉
